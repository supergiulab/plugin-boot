# Plugin Boot

This is a code base to develop Wordpress Plugins.
To create your own plugin just do the following:

1) Rename the plugin folder with your **unique** plugin slug
2) Rename plugin-boot.php with your plugin slug and fix reference in index.php
3) Rename the SetupPlugin file and PHP class and fix reference in main plugin file

Good luck and remember that Code is Poetry
