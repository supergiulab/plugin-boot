# Plugin Boot

This is a code base to develop Wordpress Plugins.
To create your own plugin just do the following:

1) Rename the plugin folder with your **unique** plugin slug
2) Rename plugin-boot.php with your plugin slug and fix reference in index.php
3) Set your namespace and run `composer dumpautoload`

Code is Poetry
